# ProcessBusIec61850
This project contains an OMNeT++/INET extension to support IEC61850 process bus communication (GOOSE and SV).
The followings simulation models were developed:
- Merging Unit simulation model that permits to configure the sample rate (protection profile and measurement profile).
- Protection and Control (P&C) IED simulation model that process SV and GOOSE messages but only generates GOOSE messages.
- Networking Switch simulation model that suports IEEE 802.1q VLAN and Priority Tagging using fixed priorities Queues. 
This project is intended for educational purpose.
