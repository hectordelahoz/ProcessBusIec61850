TraCI client modules to connect OMNeT++ and the SUMO road traffic simulator.

This simulation requires SUMO to be started and listening for TraCI commands
on a TCP socket, e.g. using "sumo-gui -c sumo.sumo.cfg".

SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous
road traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks.
