TraCI client modules to connect OMNeT++ and the SUMO road traffic simulator
via sumo-launchd.

This simulation requires sumo-launchd to be started and listening for
connections on a TCP socket, e.g. using
"~/src/inet/etc/sumo-launchd.py -vv -c /path/to/sumo/bin/sumo".
or
"~/src/inet/etc/sumo-launchd.py -vv -c /path/to/sumo/bin/sumo-gui".

This simulation requires SUMO ( http://sumo.sourceforge.net ).
SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous
road traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks.
