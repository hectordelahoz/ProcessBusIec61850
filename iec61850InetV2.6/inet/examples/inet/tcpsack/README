In this example the network consists of one client, one router and one server.
IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files.

The client sends 100 MB of data to the server using TCP.

The OrdinalBasedDropper at client's PPP interface deletes certain DATA packets.
On server side a second OrdinalBasedDropper deletes certain ACK packets in config 1-5.
In config 6 the server duplicates certain received DATA packets.

Different configurations reflect examples from RFC 2018 and RFC 2883 to evaluate
the implementation of TCP's optional selective acknowledgment (SACK) option.
